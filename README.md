# Stock_earnings_analysis
A script for gathering and displaying stock price data and the effect of earnings calls. 

Some simple data manipulation to display the difference in stock prices before and after earnings calls in different quarters. The year parameter can be freely changed, as well as the days before and days after parameter. 
Code does seem to run for a while, partly because of a not perfect overlap with the tickers list/information.
Huge thanks to user @rreichel3 for providing the ticker information in the 'US-Stock_Symbols' repository, json file is sources directly from there.

Currently no comments in the code because of intended private use.
